### How to Play

To **start** the game, open **_index.html_** in a JavaScript-enabled browser. You (the player) will be at the bottom of the screen. Using the arrow keys, make your way to the safe zone(top stone row) without colliding with the ladybugs. A collision results in a game restart. When the player reaches the top - you win points!

### Moving the Player

* _Up_ arrow moves the player one row up towards the top.
* _Down_ arrow moves the player one row down toward the bottom of the screen.
* _Left_ arrow moves the player one column to the left.
* _Right_ arrow moves the player one column to the right.
